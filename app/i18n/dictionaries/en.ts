                'Amidst workflows heavily reliant on LINE as a central communication hub, many teams continue to face issues with expired files, lost information, miscommunication, and confusion over task responsibilities. Recently, the "Arkai Work Assistant" was developed—an intelligent LINE assistant specifically designed to solve these problems.',
                'One of the main pain points of working via LINE is the limitation on file storage and retrieving past data. Arkai Work Assistant allows users to save files from chats permanently to the cloud, search for past files by name or date, summarize daily discussions, and automatically extract key takeaways or meeting resolutions.',
                'Users can simply type commands like "summarize today\'s chat" or "find yesterday\'s file" for immediate execution.',
                'Beyond file storage, Arkai Work Assistant can create tasks from conversations, assign responsibilities, and set deadlines directly within a LINE group—reducing confusion about "who does what" and preventing missed deadlines. The system also features a Memory function that remembers the important context of each group, allowing users to ask retroactively, "What did we agree on regarding this?" or "Who is responsible for this task?"',
                'Arkai Work Assistant is built to support individual users, SME teams, and large enterprises, offering package tiers that determine cloud storage space, data retention periods, and AI usage limits. Under the hood, the system utilizes a modular backend architecture, enabling future scalability—whether integrating with websites, applications, or other enterprise systems under the Arkai AI Core.',
